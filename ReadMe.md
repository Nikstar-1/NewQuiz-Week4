Coding Quiz Challenge 

On a journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that I’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding 
assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
To help me to become familiar with these tests and give a chance to apply the skills from module 4, this project is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 


Following the common templates for user stories, I have been required to frame this challenge as follows:


## User Story

AS A coding student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers



## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button

THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question

THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over

THEN I can save my initials and score


## Challenges 


I found getting the timer on this project challenging then, to reduce 10 seconds for every wrong answer. 


Alligning CSS. 


## Success's


Seeing an activated quiz with working functionality. 


## Screenshots:

## How to access?


This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.


## Tech


This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 


## Future_Improvements


In the future, I'd like to add:

More quiz questions.

Randomize questions and choices.

A check to make sure user's score is in top 10 before adding it to localStorage.

More info in quiz-info-box, such as number of questions, and time alotted.
